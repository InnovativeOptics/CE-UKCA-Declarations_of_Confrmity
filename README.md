# CE-UKCA-Declarations_of_Confrmity
The R code needed to generate DoCs in RShiny

Requires product specs core data and CE technical information to work (not to be confused with the regular technical information data which does not contain product specs).

The apps are deployed on shinyapps.io at the following links:
CE: https://invo.shinyapps.io/ce_doc/
UKCA: https://invo.shinyapps.io/uk_doc/

These docs are avaiable to anyone that is looking for them, including regulators!
